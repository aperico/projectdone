# projectdone

The main goal of this project is to simply gather in one place the results of
experiences I had on my studies with the processes surrounding software
engineering and development. In order to "externalize" these experiences on an
useful form, the results will be implemented on a set of guidelines and tools
that can (hopefully) be used throughout software projects.

I will try to develop tools and guidelines that can support on:
* Knowledge management
* Requirements elicitation and definition
* System Design
* System Implementation
* System Testing
* Deployment
* Maintenance
