# projectdone

The main goal of this project is to simply gather in one place the results of
experiences I had on my studies (M.Sc. Software Engineering) with the processes
surrounding software engineering and development. In order to "externalize"
these experiences on an useful form, a set of guidelines and tools will be
developed and (hopefully) could be used throughout software projects.

The results of this project shall provide support for areas like:
* Knowledge management
* Requirements elicitation and definition
* System Design
* System Implementation
* System Testing
* Deployment
* Maintenance


## Why ?!
Developers (like me) tend to focus on specific tasks that sometimes are not very
collaborative for the project goals. Hopefully with a set of supportive tools,
this project could help us on realizing our tasks more efficiently and always
consistent with the project goals.
