# projectdone

The main goal of this project is to gather common knowledge related with the
processes surrounding the software engineering and development environments.
These processes includes:
* Knowledge management
* Requirements elicitation and definition
* System Design
* System Implementation
* Testing
* Deployment
* Maintenance

In order to externalize the knowledge acquired on a useful form, the results
will be implemented on a set of guidelines and tools that could be used
throughout software projects in order to consistently delivery solid work
products.
